hello. I am neggles (formerly neg2led in some places)
I like to make stuff, and some of it is published here:

# [blorg](./blog)
there will be a blog here eventually

# [electronics projects](./electronics)
this is probably what you're here for

# [software/code repos](./software)
I'm not a software developer, I just play one on TV

# [hardware hackery](./hackery)
repurposing and modifying things for fun and profit

# [pi case 40 shutdown](./pi-case-40)
how to use the shutdown button on a Cooler Master Pi Case 40 without their bloated utility

# [repos](./repos)
all my public github repos (except forks)
